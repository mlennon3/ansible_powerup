This will download a 8gb box file!

Try:
``` $ vagrant up```
If you don't have vagrant installed, do this stuff:

```$ brew install ansible caskroom/cask/brew-cask```

```$ brew cask install vagrant virtualbox```

To run the vagrant machine the first time:

``` $ vagrant up```

You should get a new mac osx virtual machine to play with
